# A readme file about me 🌻

### Hi! I’m Elisse a.k.a. Lili

### I’m a professional architect working my way into IT Quality Assurance. I briefly tried out working as a Graphic Designer too. Both my previous experience allowed me to enjoy seeing and working on cohesiveness, details, timeliness, and beauty in design. I think finding bugs and making test solutions is a satisfyingly creative work 🖌

### I'm currently gearing up for comprehensive Test Automation.

## My interests are:
### 🦄 gaming
### 🍿 some anime
### 🌊 ocean conservation (and surfing)
### 😉 music that ranges from classical to techno
### 🫁 yoga, running, & cycling
### 🎨 painting & illustration
